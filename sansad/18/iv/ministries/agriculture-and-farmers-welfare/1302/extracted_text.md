(a) & (b) : The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments concerned. The Central Government provides requisite logistics and financial support to the efforts of the State Governments. The State Governments provide financial relief to the affected people in the event of 12 notified natural disasters which includes drought and flood, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at its disposal, in accordance with approved items and norms of Government of India. However, in the event of disaster of a severe nature, additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), as per laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team. The financial assistance provided under SDRF and NDRF is by way of relief and not for compensation.

Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) is implementing Rainfed Area Development (RAD) across the country from 2014-15. RAD as a component of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) focuses on Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variability. Under RAD, crops/ cropping system is integrated with activities like horticulture, livestock, fishery, agro-forestry, apiculture etc. to enable farmers, not only in maximizing farm returns for sustaining livelihood but also to mitigate the impacts of drought, flood or other extreme weather events.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has launched a flagship network project namely National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA). The project aims to study the impact of climate change on agriculture including crops, livestock, horticulture and fisheries and to develop and promote climate resilient technologies in agriculture which will address vulnerable areas of the country and the outputs of the project help the districts and regions prone to extreme weather conditions like droughts, floods, frost, heat waves, etc. to cope with such extremes.

In addition, the Government of India has introduced yield based "Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana" (PMFBY) and weather based "Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme" (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016 season to provide financial support to the farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to stabilize the income of the farmers. Comprehensive risk insurance is provided under the scheme from pre-harvesting to post-harvest losses. Under this Scheme, the claims are paid to only those farmers who have insured their crops and paid their share of premium under any of the notified crop insurance scheme in the notified area/crop by the State Government.
