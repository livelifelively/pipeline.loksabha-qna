Approximately 2060 NF Model demonstration Farms will be established for hands on training on natural farming. For the trained farmers, output based incentive of ₹4,000 per acre per farmer per year upto 2 years is provisioned in the scheme for practicing NF package of practices like Pre Monsoon Dry Sowing (PMDS), application of Beejamrit, Jeevamrit, etc., diversified cropping system, awareness on NF, upkeep of livestock, preparing NF inputs or purchasing NF inputs from BRC, purchasing drums and storage containers for input preparation etc.

The scheme provides details on soil series characteristics, characterization and taxonomic classification. Interpretative grouping of soils for land capability, soil and land irrigation suitability and hydrologic soil grouping is also done to understand soil health and land use patterns in the state.

SLUSI and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC, ISRO) together have also completed soil resource mapping on 1:50K scale using Remote Sensing and GIS for the entire state (19.17 M ha). Soil and Land Use Survey of India has also completed the generation of soil fertility map in 111 model villages in Karnataka state.
