(a) to (d) National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) under the aegis of National Health
Mission (NHM) is implemented across the country with the objective of early detection of
TB cases, appropriate management and prevent new TB cases. Specific measures taken by
the Government for early diagnosis and treatment of Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB are as
under:

- Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing (UDST) is implemented to ensure every
  diagnosed TB patient is tested for drug resistance at the time of diagnosis.
- Scale up molecular diagnostic laboratories to 8,295 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test
  (NAAT) machines to cover all districts of the country.
- 100 Line Probe Assay and 69 liquid culture testing laboratories have been
  established for diagnosis of multi drug resistance.
- 6 National Reference Laboratories and 34 Intermediate Reference Laboratories have
  been established in the country.
- 826 Drug Resistant TB treatment centres have been established across all districts.
- In 2021, shorter, safer, all oral drug resistant TB treatment regimen has been
  introduced.
- In 2024, a newer. shorter and more efficacious treatment regimen (BPaLM)
  consisting of four-drug combination Bedaquiline, Pretomanid, Linezolid and
  Moxifloxacinhas been introduced for management of drug-resistant TB

As per the Global TB Report, 2024 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were 1.1
lakh estimated drug-resistant TB cases in India during 2023. The State/UT-wise number of
drug-resistant TB cases notified in 2024, along with numbers of patients treated successfully
and deaths among the cases initiated on treatment in 2023 is placed as Annexure.

The Government has already procured Bedaquiline and as on 04.02.2025, 43.29 lakh tablets of
Bedaquiline are available with the programme across all levels.
