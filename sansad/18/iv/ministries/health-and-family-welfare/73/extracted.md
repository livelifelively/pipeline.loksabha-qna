**(a) & (b)** The Department of Health and Family Welfare, under **National Health Mission (NHM)**, provides technical and financial support to States/UTs for the **National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD)**. The program strengthens infrastructure, human resources, early diagnosis, referral, treatment, and health promotion for NCDs, including cancer. Under NP-NCD, 770 District NCD Clinics, 233 Cardiac Care Units, 372 District Day Care Centres, and 6,410 NCD clinics at CHCs have been set up.

**Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)** conduct risk assessments for individuals aged 30+ using the Community-Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC), referring high-risk cases for screening. A population-based initiative for screening, management, and prevention of NCDs, including cancer, is part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care under NHM. Prevention and screening services are delivered through ASHAs, Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM), Community Health Centres, and district hospitals, with training modules for health workers.

ASHAs play a key role in community awareness, promoting healthy lifestyles, and emphasizing early detection. Platforms like **Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC)/ Mahila Aaarogya Samiti (MAS), Jan Aarogya Samiti (JAS), Self Help Groups (SHG)** and local bodies enhance awareness efforts. The Anganwadi scheme educates pregnant and lactating women on nutrition.

Awareness initiatives include **National Cancer Awareness Day**, media campaigns, and NHM-funded activities (₹3-5 lakh at district level and ₹50-70 lakh at State level). NHM supports health infrastructure, human resources, free drugs, and diagnostics to improve healthcare accessibility.

Essential cancer drugs are available at district and sub-divisional hospitals. Government hospitals provide free or subsidized NCD treatment for the poor and needy. Under **Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)** health cover provision of ₹5 lakhs per family is made for 55 crore beneficiaries for secondary and tertiary care, including cancer treatment under 200+ packages. Recent approval extends PM-JAY coverage to all senior citizens (70+). The **Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)** scheme operates 14,320 Janaushadhi Kendras, offering 2,047 types of medicines and 300 surgical, medical consumables and devices, out of which 87 products are available for treatment of cancer. **AMRIT** pharmacies sell discounted cancer drugs, with 220 stores nationwide.

Cancer treatment facilities have been approved in all 22 new AIIMS with diagnostic, medical and surgical facilities.

The **National Cancer Institute (NCI)at Jhajjar, Haryana**, has been setup. It has 1,460 patient care beds and advanced diagnostic and treatment facilities. The second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in Kolkata, has also been setup.

**Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)** conducts research on cancer through its institutes, various projects and cancer consortium in the areas of gall bladder cancer, breast cancer, lung cancers, cancers in North-east and oral cancers through its centrally sponsored research projects.

ICMR funds **National Health Research Priority (NHRP)** projects on breast and oral cancer screening and joint research with the National Cancer Grid. Additional fellowships, ad-hoc, and task force projects continue under ICMR's initiatives.
