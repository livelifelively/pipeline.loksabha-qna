**STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA**
**STARRED QUESTION NO. 64 FOR 7TH FEBRUARY, 2025**

**(a) to (c):** Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is a flagship scheme of the Government which provides health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to approximately 55 crore beneficiaries corresponding to 12.37 crore families constituting economically vulnerable bottom 40% of India's population. Recently, the scheme has been expanded to cover 6 crore senior citizens of age 70 years and above belonging to 4.5 crore families irrespective of their socio-economic status under AB-PMJAY with Vay Vandana Card. As on 01.01.2025, a total of 8.59 crore hospital admissions worth Rs.1.19 lakh crore have been authorized under the scheme.

AB-PMJAY is governed on a zero-tolerance approach towards any kind of fraud and abuse and various steps are taken for prevention, detection and deterrence of different kinds of fraud that could occur in the scheme at different stages of its implementation. National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) has been established at National Health Authority (NHA) and works in close coordination with State Anti-Fraud Units (SAFU) to investigate and take joint action against issues related to fraud and abuse.

Suitable actions including de-empanelment of 1114 hospitals, levying penalty worth Rs. 122 crore on 1504 errant hospitals and suspension of 549 hospitals have been taken against fraudulent entities as reported by the States/UTs. Further, any claims by empanelled hospitals found to be suspicious by NAFU are withheld until proper scrutiny by SAFU teams including field verification where necessary.

As on 04.02.2025, a total of 9 doctors and 71 hospitals have been suspended under the scheme in the State of Gujarat. Additionally, 2 hospitals have been de-empanelled and 1 hospital has been blacklisted. A total recovery of ₹15.08 crore has been made, while penalties amounting to ₹19.90 crore have been imposed.
