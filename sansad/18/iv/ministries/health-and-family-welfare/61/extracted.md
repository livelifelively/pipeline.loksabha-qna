## STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA

## STARRED QUESTION NO. 61 FOR 7TH FEBRUARY, 2025

**(a) and (b):** As per the Special Bulletin on Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) released by the Sample Registration System (SRS) 2018-20, the MMR of Maharashtra has been reduced from 61 per lakh live births in 2014-16 to 33 per lakh live births in 2018-20 and MMR of Bihar has been reduced from 165 per lakh live births in 2014-16 to 118 per lakh live births in 2018-20.

Over the past 30 years, the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in India has declined by an impressive 83%, compared to the global reduction of 42%.

Similarly, as per the Sample Registration System (SRS) 2020, the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) of Maharashtra has been reduced from 22 per 1000 live births in 2014 to 16 per 1000 live births in 2020 and the IMR of Bihar has been reduced from 42 per 1000 live births in 2014 to 27 per 1000 live births in 2020.

Over the past 30 years, the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in India has dropped by 69%, against a global decline of 55%.

The Government of India has undertaken various initiatives/measures under the National Health Mission (NHM) to improve maternal and infant health outcomes across the country including the States of Maharashtra and Bihar which are as follows:

- **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)** is a demand promotion and conditional cash transfer scheme for promoting institutional delivery.

- **Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)** entitles all pregnant women and sick infants (up to one year of age) delivering in public health institutions to have absolutely free and no-expense delivery, including caesarean section. The entitlements include free drugs and consumables, free diet during the stay, free diagnostics, free transportation and free blood transfusion, if required. Similar entitlements are also in place for sick infants.

- **Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)** provides pregnant women a fixed day, free of cost, assured and quality antenatal checkup by a Specialist/Medical Officer on the 9th day of every month.

- **Extended PMSMA strategy** focuses on quality antenatal care (ANC) for pregnant women, especially high-risk pregnant (HRP) women and individual HRP tracking with financial incentivization for the identified high-risk pregnant women and accompanying Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) for extra 3 visits over and above the PMSMA visit.

- **Monthly Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Day** is an outreach activity at Anganwadi centers for provision of maternal and child care including nutrition in convergence with the ICDS.

- **Outreach camps** are provisioned to improve the reach of health care services, especially in tribal and hard-to-reach areas. This platform is used to increase awareness for Maternal and Child health services and community mobilization as well as to track high-risk pregnancies.

- The establishment of **Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs)** and **Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSUs)** under **Facility Based Newborn Care (FBNC)** program provides specialized care to sick and small newborns at district and sub-district levels, addressing neonatal health complications.

- The **Mother Absolute Affection (MAA) Program** promotes breastfeeding practices, emphasizing the importance of early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding in young children.

- **Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)** conduct scheduled home visits under **Home-Based Newborn Care (HBNC)** and **Home-Based Care of Young Children (HBYC)**, improving child-rearing practices and identifying sick newborns and young children for timely referral and care.

These comprehensive interventions under National Health Mission (NHM) have collectively contributed to the significant decline in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) across the States.

**(c)** The Government of India focuses on achieving and maintaining replacement levels of fertility by raising awareness about healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies for the well-being of mother and child, providing for the availability of family planning services, and approving the budgets proposed by the states in the Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) based on their specific needs to manage fertility.

Various schemes implemented by the Government under Family Planning programme are given below-

- **Expanded Contraceptive Choices:** The contraceptive basket comprising Condoms, combined oral contraceptive pills, Emergency contraceptive pills, intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) and Sterilization was expanded with the inclusion of new contraceptives namely Injectable contraceptive MPA (Antara Programme) and Centchroman (Chhaya).

- **Mission Parivar Vikas** is being implemented in thirteen states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland and Mizoram) for substantially increasing access to contraceptives and Family Planning services.

- **'World Population Day & Fortnight' and 'Vasectomy Fortnight'** are observed every year to boost awareness of Family Planning and service delivery across all States/UTs

**(d)** The details of the funds approved under NHM for enhancing healthcare infrastructure and services for the states of Maharashtra and Bihar in rural areas are given below:

| Name of the States | Approved budget 2023-24 (In Lakhs)   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

**(e)** National Health Mission (NHM) aims to attain universal access to equitable, affordable and quality healthcare services, accountable and responsive to people's needs, with effective intersectoral convergent action to address the wider social determinants of health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provides technical and financial support to the States/Union Territories to strengthen the public healthcare system, based on the proposals received in the form of Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) under NHM.
