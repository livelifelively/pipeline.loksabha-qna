**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE**
**(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)**

**(a) to (g)** The Ministry through Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has conducted a National TB Prevalence Survey in 20 State/group of States to assess burden of TB at sub-national level. The survey found that the prevalence of all forms of TB cases in 2021 for all ages was 312/lakh population in the country. As per the Global TB Report 2024, the incidence of TB in India has reduced from 237/lakh population in 2015 to 195/lakh population in 2023.

Further, to find all TB cases and initiate appropriate treatment, the key activities undertaken are as under:

- Targeted interventions in high TB burden areas through State and district specific strategic plans.
- Provision of free drugs and diagnostics to TB patients.
- Active TB case finding campaigns in key vulnerable populations and individuals with co-morbidities.
- Decentralized TB screening and treatment services to the level of AyushmanArogyaMandir.
- Private sector engagement with incentives for notification and management of TB cases.
- Scale up of molecular diagnostic laboratories to sub-district levels.
- Intensified Information, Education & Communication interventions to reduce stigma, enhance community awareness and improve health seeking behaviour.
- Converge efforts and resources of line ministries for TB elimination.
- Provision of TB Preventive Treatment to contacts of TB patients and vulnerable population.
- Track notified TB cases and their contacts through Ni-kshay portal.
- Provision of TB Preventive Treatment to eligible contacts of TB patients and vulnerable population.

Further, the details of estimated TB incidence, TB deaths per minute and the details of the budgetary allocation for TB, since 2014 are placed at Table 1 & 2 of Annexure.
