**ANSWER**

**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY
WELFARE**

**(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)**

**(a) and (b)** The Government is aware of the findings of the IIT Madras study in 2021 which
analysed the prevalence of caesarean sections (C-section) between private and public
hospitals nationwide, specifically in Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh. The study highlights
trends observed over the five-year interval between the two rounds of the National Family
Health Survey (NFHS-4 and NFHS-5).

**(c)** As per the report of Population Research Centre (PRC) - JSS Institute of Economic
Research Dharwad, Karnataka under Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW),
Government of India, a study conducted on “Understanding the Context of Caesarean

Delivery from the Providers' and Receivers' Perspectives", mentions the main reasons
behind the increase rate of C-section Deliveries in the country as;

- **Clinical Decision-Making by Doctor:** Clinical indications, such as maternal age,
  multiple pregnancies, fetal distress, previous C-sections, prolonged labour, placenta
  previa, as well as maternal complications have a greater likelihood of caesarean
  delivery.
- **Patient/Community Preferences:** These have decision-making role in the matter

**(d) to (f)** Under National Health Mission, various measures/initiatives have been taken to
address the arising challenges pertaining to high C-section rates, including establishment of
monitoring mechanism in all States/UTs in the country which are as follows:

- CGHS empanelled hospitals are required to prominently display information
  regarding the ratio of deliveries by Caesarean section vis-à-vis normal deliveries.
- Data Reporting and monitoring has been strengthened at health care facilities.
- Under LaQshya initiative, a dedicated C-section audit component is embedded in the
  LaQshya assessment checklist for Maternity OTs for all Government Hospitals.
- Various training programs, including Daksh, Dakshta, Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA)
  and Nurse Practitioner Midwifery (NPM) have been instituted to ensure the
  availability of well-trained human resources, especially in remote areas in order to
  promote normal deliveries.
