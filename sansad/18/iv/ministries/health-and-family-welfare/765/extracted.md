healthcare services is that of the respective State Governments. However, to mitigate the
challenges posed by rare diseases in India, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)
notified the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD) on 30.3.2021. Under the policy 63
categories of Rare Diseases are identified which are further divided into three groups.
Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) are group three disorders which include diseases such as
the Gaucher, Pompe and Fabry diseases. Around 700 patients of LSDs are registered under
NPRD at 12 CoEs (as on November 2024). Under NPRD, financial assistance upto Rs. 50 lakh
per patient is provided for treatment of patients suffering from any of the 63 Rare Diseases
identified under the policy. MoHFW provides funds to the Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for
treatment of rare disease patients.
