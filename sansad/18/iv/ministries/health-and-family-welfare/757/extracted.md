**(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)**

(a) The Government of India has implemented the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) which is a comprehensive framework established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), aimed at ensuring and enhancing the quality of healthcare services provided at public health facilities.

    Initially, the Standards were applied for District Hospitals, aiming to ensure that services provided through public health facilities are safe, patient-centric, and of assured quality. Subsequently, these standards were extended to Sub-District Hospitals (SDH), Community Health Centers (CHCs), Ayushman Arogya Mandir -Urban Primary Health Centre (AAM-UPHC), Ayushman Arogya Mandir- Primary Health Centre (AAM-PHC), and Ayushman Arogya Mandirs Sub-Centers (AAM-SHCs).

    For ease of compliance in assessment, digital technology was leveraged and 'Virtual Assessment for National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Certification of Ayushman Arogya Mandir- Sub Health Centers (AAM-SHCs)' was launched on 28<sup>th</sup> June, 2024.

    On June 28, 2024, the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) for Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs) were launched to enhance the accuracy and precision of testing processes and results.

(b) As on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2024, total 22,786 number of health facilities have received NQAS certification in the country.

(c) to (f) The Bharat Health Initiative for Sahyog Hita & Maitri (BHISHM) Cubes are advanced mobile modular kits, designed to offer rapid, first-line medical care in the management of patients during first few hours following a disaster situation or public health emergencies.

    The BHISHM Cube is built for maximum flexibility and for rapid deployment, with the ability to be delivered by air, sea, land, or drones, enabling quick response in remote or conflict zones. This multi-modal deployment capability ensures that the cubes can reach the most critical areas with minimal delay.

    BHISHM Cubes are specifically engineered to handle a broad spectrum of patients that are common in disaster zones, which includes trauma, hemorrhage, burns, fractures, and other life-threatening injuries. In addition to its medical capabilities, each BHISHM Cube is equipped with survival provisions for a medical crew of up to five personnel for 48 hours. This includes food, water, shelter, power stations, and other survival aids, ensuring that teams can operate independently in austere conditions until further assistance arrives.
