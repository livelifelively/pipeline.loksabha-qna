**ANSWER**
**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY**
**WELFARE**
**(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)**

(a): Several activities have been undertaken to ensure the effective implementation of Ayushman
Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) like improved beneficiary
identification, enhanced service uptake, increased awareness, and effective monitoring of the
scheme.

To enhance beneficiary identification, the National Health Authority (NHA) has enriched
databases, upgraded technology with Beneficiary Identification System 2.0 (BIS 2.0) for easier
card generation, and implemented campaigns like "Aapke Dwar Ayushman" to mobilize millions.
Further, a revamped BIS has improved the beneficiary identification system with features like
access to village-wise data that helps in beneficiary mobilization at ground level, mobile
application based card creation, and engagement of Field Level Workers (FLWs) for door-to-
door campaigns. The feature of self registration is also available in the mentioned application.

Service uptake is boosted through rationalization of Health Benefit Packages (HBP 2022), and
introduction of beneficiary facilitation agencies. In order to improve the participation of hospitals
NHA has revised HBP with increased number of procedures (1961). Further, rates have been
increased for 350 packages and new packages have been added. Beneficiary empowerment
efforts include engagement with FLWs, initiatives like Ayushman Mitra, and the issuance of
Adhikar and Abhinandan Patras to inform and engage beneficiaries. Awareness campaigns
leverage diverse media platforms to disseminate information.

A dashboard with various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is designed to monitor the
performance of the AB-PMJAY. The dashboard is used to objectively evaluate the scheme's
performance in terms of metrics such as the number of cards issued, hospital admissions, quality
of treatment provided, and timely settlement of claims. In addition to this, regular review
meetings are organized with stakeholders including State Health Agencies (SHAs) to assess
scheme's implementation.

(b): As on 04.02.2025, more than 36.36 crore Ayushman Cards have been created under the
scheme and approximately 7.39 crore claims have been submitted by the empanelled health care
providers, out of this approx 6.22 crore claims have been settled under the scheme.

(c): Under AB-PMJAY, a three-tier grievance redressal system at District, State, and National
level has been created to resolve the issues faced by beneficiaries in utilizing healthcare services,
including rural and underserved areas. At each level, there is a dedicated nodal officer and
Grievance Redressal Committees to address the grievances.

Beneficiaries can also file their grievance using different mediums including web-based portal
Centralized Grievance Redressal Management System (CGRMS), Central & State call centers
(14555), email, letter to SHAs etc. Based on the nature of grievance, necessary action, including
providing support to the beneficiaries in availing treatment under the scheme, for resolution of
grievances is taken.

Further, AB-PMJAY has a comprehensive media and outreach strategy to spread awareness and
empower beneficiaries for their rights and entitlements, prominently in rural areas. This includes
intensive advertisement over traditional media platforms including newspapers, community radio,
street plays, digital displays, radio campaigns, mass messaging, telecast of beneficiary
testimonials via Doordarshan, etc. Further, State Health Agencies have also engaged the wide
network of frontline workers like ASHAs, AWWs and VLEs (Village Level Entrepreneurs), who
have been pivotal in creating mass awareness at the grassroot level. Various other initiatives have
been undertaken including deployment of Ayushman Mitra, toll free helpline “14555",
mechanism for feedback etc. with the objective to foster wider societal engagement and
empower beneficiaries for availing healthcare services under the scheme. Eligible beneficiaries
are distributed PVC Ayushman cards as a token of empowerment under the scheme.

(d): National Health Authority (NHA) engages with State Health Agencies to increase the
number of empaneled hospitals under the scheme in order to expand the available options for the
beneficiaries to avail quality healthcare services. Currently over 30,072 hospitals are empanelled
under the scheme out of which 13,173 are private hospitals. In order to improve the participation
of hospitals, following actions have been taken:
i. NHA has released a revised HBP with increased number of procedures (1961) across 27
specialties Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and complications arising due to NCDs
like Stroke Management, Coronary Angioplasty, Coronary Bypass, Accelerated
Hypertension and Diabetic Foot etc. Further, rates have been increased for 350 packages
and new packages have been added.
ii. Claim settlement is monitored at the highest level and it is ensured that claim is settled
within defined turnaround time.
iii. NHA has launched an improved version of the Hospital Engagement Module (HEM 2.0)
for enhancing the empanelment process of the hospitals.
iv. Virtual and physical capacity building of hospitals are undertaken.
v. A hospital-specific call center (14413) has been set-up to address the concerns of
hospitals on a real-time basis.
vi. District Implementation Units (DIUs) have been set-up to regularly visit empanelled
hospitals to understand the issues faced by beneficiaries and hospitals.

As public health is a State subject, the responsibility of empaneling hospitals under AB-PMJAY
lies with the respective State/UT. Also, hospital empanelment is a continuous process and is
undertaken based on the requirements and availability of healthcare providers (meeting AB-
PMJAY criteria) within a given State / UT. The Government of India encourages States/UTs to
empanel more hospitals under the scheme to ensure access to quality healthcare to all eligible
beneficiaries.

(e): Government of India has implemented various measures for on-ground analysis of AB-
PMJAY. A Monitoring and Research (M&R) division continuously tracks the scheme's real time
progress. Further, the progress of the scheme is assessed and monitored continuously. A
dashboard with various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) has been designed to constantly
monitor the scheme. The performance of the scheme is objectively evaluated in terms of cards
issued, number of hospital admissions, quality of treatment provided, timely settlement of claims
etc. Constant feedback is provided to the States/UTs with regards to the implementation of the
scheme.

Further, a baseline study was commissioned by NHA in 2019-2020 to understand the impact of
AB PM-JAY. The study inter-alia recommended strategies to increase awareness of the scheme,
addressing barriers to access to healthcare services to ensure that all people in need of
specialized care receive care, replicating experiences from other settings like dedicated staff to
guide and assist beneficiaries, establishing communication and feedback channels to allow
beneficiaries to voice their concerns.
