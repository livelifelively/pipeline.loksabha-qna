**(a)** : Presently, no such consolidated data on countrywide incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is available. However, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that 83.2 per cent of invasive cervical cancers are attributed to HPVs 16 or 18. As per the National Cancer Registry Program (ICMR-NCRP) report, 2020, State/UT wise list of the estimated number of incidence of cervical cancer cases from 2019-2023 is enclosed in Annexure- I.

**(b)** : National Technical Advisory Group on immunization (NTAGI) has informed that the 17th NTAGI meeting, held on 28th June 2022, recommended the introduction of the HPV vaccine in the Universal Immunization Program (UIP).

**(c) and (d)** : The Universal Immunization Program (UIP) provides 11 vaccines against 12 Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs). However the HPV vaccine is not a part of the Universal Immunization Program (UIP).
