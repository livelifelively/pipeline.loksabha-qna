**(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)**

**(a) to (g):** As per information provided by National Board of Examination in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), the result of Foreign Medical Graduate Exam (FMGE) is declared as per the schedule published in the information bulletin.

There are no such incidents of withholding/delaying the declaration of FMGE result. However, the results of some candidates are withheld in last five years for the following specific reasons:-

- Face ID/Biometric verification required to ascertain identity of candidate to rule out impersonation.
- Requirement of Security Clearance from Ministry of Home Affairs.
- Unfair means adopted by candidates and these cases are under consideration of NBEMS Examination Ethics Committee.
- Non-issuance of Eligibility Certificate by National Medical Commission and candidate was allowed to appear in the exam vide interim orders of various Courts.

The year-wise data of FMGE results that were withheld for the above mentioned reasons are as under:

| YEAR | Total Number of results withheld |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 2020 | 0                                |
| 2021 | 25                               |
| 2022 | 8                                |
| 2023 | 5                                |
| 2024 | 39                               |

As per NBEMS, there is no provision of re-evaluation/re-totalling/rechecking of marks in FMGE. Furthermore, there is no pending court case regarding withholding of FMGE result.
