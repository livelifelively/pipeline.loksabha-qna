**ANSWER**

**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE**

**(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)**

**(a):** Yes, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 13.01.2025 between National Health Authority (NHA) and State of Odisha for the implementation of Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) in the State of Odisha.

**(b):** Under AB-PMJAY, approximately 1.03 crore beneficiary families (approximately 3.35 crore beneficiaries) shall be covered in the State of Odisha including approximately 3.87 lakh and 1.24 lakh beneficiaries families in Bargarh and Jharsuguda district respectively.

Further, 17.32 lakh beneficiary families of senior citizens of age 70 years and above irrespective of their socio-economic status shall also be benefited under AB-PMJAY with Ayushman Vay Vandana Card.

**(c):** AB-PMJAY currently provides financial assistance in the form of free healthcare access up to Rs. 5 lakh per eligible family per year, for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization in 27 different medical specialties through a network of around 30,000 empanelled health care providers.

**(d):** AB-PMJAY has a comprehensive media and outreach strategy to spread awareness and empower beneficiaries for their rights and entitlements more prominently in rural and backward areas. This includes advertisement over traditional media platforms including newspapers, community radio, street plays, digital displays, radio campaigns, mass messaging, and telecast of beneficiary testimonials via Doordarshan etc. In addition to this, State Health Agencies have also engaged the wide network of frontline workers i.e., ASHAs, AWWs and VLEs (Village Level Entrepreneurs) who are pivotal in creating mass awareness at the grassroot level.

Further, the government has issued directions to the states to undertake extensive IEC activities to raise the awareness about the scheme.

**(e):** The funding of AB-PMJAY is entirely demand driven. NHA releases funds for scheme implementation to the States/UTs on the basis of the actual demand received from them. There is no State/UT-wise allocation of funds. As per the defined process, States/UTs are required to furnish a Utilization Certificate of previously received funds prior to every new fund release.

The central share of funds is released to the implementing States and Union Territories on the basis of premium discovered or actual claims amount (depending upon the mode of scheme implementation in the State/UT) corresponding to eligible AB-PMJAY families in such States/UTs, subject to annual per-family ceiling as per extant guidelines.
