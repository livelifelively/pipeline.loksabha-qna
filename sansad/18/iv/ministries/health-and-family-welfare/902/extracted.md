## ANSWER

### THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE

### (SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)

**(a) to (d):** The primary responsibility of strengthening public healthcare system, including support for ASHA workers lies with the respective State/UT Governments. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provides the technical and financial support to the States/UTs to strengthen their public healthcare system, based on the requirements posted by States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) and within the overall resource envelope.

ASHAs receive a fixed monthly incentive of Rs. 2000 per month in the country, for routine and recurring activities. Additionally, they are provided performance-based incentives for a varied set of activities under various National Health Programmes. The Government has approved additional incentives for ASHAs in September, 2022. The details of these ASHA incentives are available on the following Uniform Resources Locator (URL):
[https://nhm.gov.in/New-Update-2023-24/ASHA/Orders_and_guidelines/ASHA-INCENTIVES.pdf](https://nhm.gov.in/New-Update-2023-24/ASHA/Orders_and_guidelines/ASHA-INCENTIVES.pdf)

Further, States/UTs provide additional incentives to ASHA workers over and above the incentives provided by the Government of India and the details are at Annexure-I.

After the launch of Ayushman Arogya Mandir, ASHAs are eligible additionally for Team Based Incentives (TBIs) along with ANMs based on monitored performance indicators (up to 1000 per month). ASHAs are also entitled to non-monetary incentives like – ASHA Uniform, Identity Card, Cycle, Mobile, CUG Sim, ASHA Diary, Drug Kit, ASHA rest room etc. The Government has also approved a cash award of ₹20,000/- and a citation to ASHAs who leave the programme after working as ASHAs for minimum of 10 years, as acknowledgement of their contribution.

In the year 2018, the ASHA benefit package was introduced acknowledging significant contribution and commitment of ASHAs. The package provides coverage for:

- Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (PMJJBY) with a benefit Rs. 2.00 Lakh in case of death of the insured (annual premium contributed by GOI).
- Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Beema Yojana (PMSBY) with a benefit of Rs.2.00 lakh for accidental death or permanent disability; Rs. 1.00 lakh for partial disability (annual premium contributed by GOI).

In addition, Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan Dhan (PM-SYM) with pension benefit of ₹3,000/- pm after age of 60 years (50% contribution of premium by GOI and 50% by beneficiaries) is also available for ASHA workers. ASHAs across the States/UTs have been enrolled in all the above-mentioned Social Security Schemes as per the defined eligibility norms.

Also, a health care annual coverage of ₹5 Lakhs under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB- PMJAY) has been extended to all ASHAs workers.

As informed by Ministry of Women and Child Development, Anganwadi workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) are honorary workers and paid a monthly honorarium as decided by the Government from time to time. From 1st October, 2018, the honorarium of AWWs at main- Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) is Rs.4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini- AWCs is Rs.3,500/- per month; Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) is Rs.2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of Rs.250/- per month to AWHs and Rs.500 to AWWs. In addition, States/UTs are also paying additional monetary incentives/honorarium to these functionaries from their own resources which vary from State to State.
