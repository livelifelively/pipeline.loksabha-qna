**ANSWER**

THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY
WELFARE
(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)

**(a) & (e):** Ministry of Commerce has informed that Indian Spices have not been banned by
countries like Singapore and Hong Kong. However, earlier, specific batches of few spice
mixtures exported from India were recalled by Food Safety Authorities in Hong Kong and
Singapore due to the presence of ethylene oxide (EtO) above permissible limits.

Spices Board, Ministry of Commerce has taken various steps including mandatory
pre-shipment testing of Spices being exported to these destinations, issuance of
comprehensive guidelines to be followed by exporters to prevent possible EtO contamination
at all stages namely; procurement of raw materials, processing, packing, storage,
transportation etc., to meet the varying EtO limits of the importing country.

Further, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is fully committed to
ensure the availability of safe food products to the consumers across the country. Towards
this, FSSAI through State/UTs and its Regional Offices conducts regular surveillance,
monitoring, inspection and random sampling of various food products including dairy
products, spices and fortified rice, to check compliance with the quality and safety
parameters and other requirements as laid down under Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act,
2006, and regulations made thereunder. In cases of non-compliance to the statutory
requirements as above, penal action is initiated against the defaulting FBOs as per the
provisions laid down under the FSS Act.

FSSAI has conducted pan-India surveillances for milk and milk products in 2011,
2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023. The report of Milk surveillance done by FSSAI in 2018,
2020 & 2022 is available in public domain at www.fssai.gov.in/cms/national-surveys.php.
FSSAI has also asked the State/UTs to deploy the Food Safety on Wheels for screening/rapid
testing of Milk and Milk products. FSSAI has conducted pan India Surveillance on spices in
2022, wherein, 82.4% samples were found safe for human consumption. In Financial year
2024-25, a targeted enforcement drive on spices was conducted in which 4216 samples were
analyzed out of which 85% of the samples found conforming with FSS Act.

For quality check of Fortified Rice, FSSAI has published standardized test methods
and has developed a dedicated portal (FoRTRACE- Fortified Rice Traceability) for ensuring
traceability in rice fortification. In FY 2024-25, the FSSAI had conducted an inspection on
Fortified Rice wherein out of 672 cases of inspections, only one case of non-compliance was
observed.

The implementation and enforcement of provisions under Food Safety and Standards
(FSS) Act, 2006 including filling up of vacancies of field-level officers primarily lies with the
State/UT Governments. No impact of vacancies on functioning of State Food Authorities has
been reported.
