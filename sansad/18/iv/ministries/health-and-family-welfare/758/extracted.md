**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE**

**(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)**

**(a) & (b):** The total number of Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs) currently operational in rural areas of the country, State/UT-wise including Tamil Nadu may be seen at the following link of RHS 2021-22:

The primary responsibility of strengthening the public healthcare system, including provision of critical human resources for health including doctors and nurses in the Primary Health Centres (PHCs), lies with the respective State Governments. Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) provide guidance on the various health system components including human resources for delivering health services at heath facilities including Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs). The IPHS 2022 adopts an outcome-driven approach, emphasizing service delivery, infrastructure, human resources, essential drugs, diagnostics, and governance (including accountability and monitoring). The guidelines of IPHS are available at website of National Health Mission (NHM) at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as under:

[https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&level=2&sublinkid=971&lid=154](https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&level=2&sublinkid=971&lid=154)

**(c) :** The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare had launched Free Diagnostics Services Initiative (FDSI) in 2015 under NHM. Under NHM,â€˜Free Diagnostic Service initiative' is delivered through in-house, Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Hybrid mode by the States/UTs in the country. Free Laboratory service is operational in 33 States, out of which 11 States/UTs (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Tripura, and Uttarakhand) are providing the services through PPP/hybrid mode and 22 States/UTs (Andhra Pradesh, A&N Island, Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, D&N Haveli-Daman & Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Puducherry, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal) provide the services through In-house mode.

**(d) :** PHCs and CHCs in rural areas have been integrated with telemedicine platform (eSanjeevani). As on 31.1.2025, 20,990 Primary Health Centres and 2,082 Community Health Centres have been enrolled on eSanjeevani Portal across States/UTs. Further, 1.23 Crores Teleconsultations have been provided through PHCs and 82,429 Teleconsultations have been provided through CHCs on eSanjeevani Platform.

**(e) & (f):** The Government of India, under the National Health Mission (NHM), has implemented various maternal and child health initiatives to enhance institutional deliveries and antenatal care, ensuring quality healthcare for all, including rural areas across the country. Key programs include Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) for incentivizing institutional deliveries, Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for pregnant women, and Surakshit Matratva Ashwasan (SUMAN) for assured, dignified maternity care. Additionally, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) ensures regular antenatal check-ups, while LaQshya improves labor room quality. The government is strengthening healthcare infrastructure through Delivery Points, First Referral Units (FRUs), and Maternal & Child Health (MCH) Wings at high caseload facilities. Capacity-building efforts include training MBBS doctors in anesthesia and obstetric care and implementing Maternal Death Surveillance Review (MDSR) to enhance maternal healthcare.

For child health, Facility-Based Newborn Care (SNCUs & NBSUs) ensures medical support for sick newborns, while Home-Based Newborn Care (HBNC) & Home-Based Care for Young Children (HBYC) engage ASHAs in improving child health practices. Mothers' Absolute Affection (MAA) promotes early and exclusive breastfeeding, and initiatives like Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS) target childhood pneumonia. The Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) covers essential vaccines, including PCV and Rotavirus vaccines, to prevent life-threatening diseases. Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) screens children for diseases and developmental issues, linking them to District Early Intervention Centres (DEICs). Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) manage Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), while Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (D2) promotes ORS and Zinc use.

To combat anaemia, the Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy under POSHAN Abhiyan strengthens testing and treatment, especially for pregnant women and adolescents. Community outreach efforts like Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND) provide maternal and child healthcare at the grassroots level. Extensive IEC/BCC activities promote awareness of ANC, institutional deliveries, and nutrition. Additionally, comprehensive abortion care services, the Midwifery Program, and the establishment of Obstetric ICUs/HDUs in tertiary care facilities enhance reproductive and maternal health services. Continuous capacity-building programs for healthcare providers ensure sustained improvements in maternal and child health outcomes across India.
