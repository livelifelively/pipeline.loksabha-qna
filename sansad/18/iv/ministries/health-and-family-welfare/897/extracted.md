**(a) and (b):** The National Health Mission (NHM) provides support for improvement in health infrastructure, availability of adequate human resources in health facilities, to improve availability and accessibility to quality healthcare especially for the under-served and marginalized groups in rural areas. This Ministry provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs to strengthen the public healthcare system, based on the proposals received in the form of Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) under NHM. The Government of India provides approval for the proposals in the form of Record of Proceedings (RoPs) as per norms & available resources.

The Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) with an outlay of Rs.64,180 crore aims to support for infrastructure development for Sub-Health Centres, Urban Health and Wellness Centres, Support for Block Public Health Units, Integrated District Public Health Laboratories and Critical Care Hospital Blocks. Total amount of Rs. 2,666.48 crore has been approved under PM-ABHIM for the State of Rajasthan for FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26.

The XV-Finance Commission has recommended grants aggregating to Rs.70,051 crore over the period of five years (2021-2026) through Local Governments to strengthen the healthcare system in states. Total amount of Rs. 4,423.06 crore has been allocated under FC-XV health grant for the State of Rajasthan for FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26.

As on 31.1.2025, a total of 1,76,325 Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) have been operationalized by upgrading existing Sub-Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) that includes preventive, promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services which are universal, free, and closer to the community.

**(c) :** The Government of India has taken number of initiatives in the form of incentives and honorarium to the medical professionals for encouraging better service delivery in rural and remote areas in the country, which include:

i. Hard Area Allowance to specialist doctors for serving in rural and remote areas so that they find it attractive to serve in public health facilities in such areas.
ii. Honorarium to Gynecologists/ Emergency Obstetric Care (EmoC) trained, Pediatricians & Anesthetist/ Life Saving Anaesthesia Skills (LSAS) trained doctors to increase availability of specialists for conducting Cesarean Sections in rural & remote area.
iii. Special incentives for doctors, incentive for ANM for ensuring timely ANC checkup and recording, incentives for conducting Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health activities.
iv. States are also allowed to offer negotiable salary to attract specialist including flexibility in strategies such as “You Quote We Pay”.
v. Non-monetary incentives such as preferential admission in postgraduate courses for staff serving in difficult areas and improving accommodation arrangement in rural areas have also been introduced under NHM.
vi. Multi-skilling of doctors is supported under NHM to overcome the shortage of specialists. Skill upgradation of existing HR is another major strategy under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) for achieving improvement in health outcomes.

**(d) to (f):** In the State of Rajasthan, AIIMS at Jodhpur has been established under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) and it is fully functional. At present, there is no proposal for second AIIMS in Rajasthan (including Jhunjhunu district) under PMSSY.
