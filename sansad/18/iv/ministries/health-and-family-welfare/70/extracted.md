**STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA**
**STARRED QUESTION NO. 70 FOR 7<sup>TH</sup> FEBRUARY, 2025**

**(a):** In order to prevent and control major Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), viz, Hypertension, Diabetes, oral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer, the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD) was launched by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India in 2010 with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facilities. Under the programme, 770 District NCD Clinics, 233 Cardiac Care Units (CCU), 372 District Day Care Centres and 6410 NCD clinics at Community Health Centre have been set up across the country.

In Odisha, 30 District NCD Clinics, 12 Cardiac Care Units (CCU), 32 District Day Care Centres and 414 Community Health Centres have been set up.

The Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, provides technical and financial support to the States and Union Territories under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD) as part of National Health Mission (NHM). The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, early diagnosis, referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facility for treatment and management and health promotion and awareness generation for prevention, of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including breast and cervical cancer.

Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) administers Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) for all individuals of 30 years and above age group in the population. Risk assessment for NCDs is done through CBAC and all the high risk individuals are referred for screening of common NCDs including Breast and Cervical cancer as part of the comprehensive primary health care under NHM.

National NCD Portal has been rolled out by the Government of India in 2018 under NP-NCD for NCD screening and management and ensuring continuum of care for five common NCDs, including breast and cervical cancer. As per National NCD Portal, disease-wise data of screening of breast and cervical cancer is as under:

| Diseases        | Screened      | Diagnosed | Under Treatment |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Breast Cancer   | 1,46,10,15,83 | 57,184    | 50,612          |
| Cervical Cancer | 9,00,80,292   | 96,747    | 86,196          |

Population Based Screening helps in better management of diseases by the way of early stage of detection, follow up and treatment adherence. Training Modules on screening, management and awareness generation for NCDs have been developed for training of various categories of health staff viz. Nurses, ANMs, ASHAs and Medical Officers.

In the community, ASHAs play a pivotal role in spreading awareness about Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including breast and cervical cancer. ASHAs educate individuals and families on the importance of adopting healthy lifestyles, including nutritious diets, regular physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. ASHAs emphasize the significance of early detection through regular health check-ups and screenings, enabling timely intervention through home visits, group meetings, and participation in health campaigns.

NP-NCD programme provides for financial support of ₹3 -5 lakhs at District level and ₹50-70 lakhs at State level for awareness generation activities for NCDs to be undertaken by the States and Union Territories.

Details of disease-wise data of screening till date for breast and cervical cancer in Odisha, is as under:

| Diseases        | Screened  | Diagnosed | Under Treatment |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Breast Cancer   | 84,90,609 | 1,051     | 361             |
| Cervical Cancer | 33,16,442 | 1,422     | 444             |

The State Government of Odisha has informed that women over 30 years are screened for breast and cervical cancer at the village level. Cervical cancer is screened using Visual Inspection through Acetic Acid (VIA) and breast cancer through Clinical Breast Examination. Further tests like Pap smears and biopsies are available at medical facilities. Free diagnostic services, including mammography, CT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and immunological tests, are offered in public health centers. District hospitals also provide colposcopy and thermo-coagulation for cervical cancer. Free cancer treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and palliative care, is available at government hospitals. Anti-cancer drugs are provided through the Niramaya (free drug initiative by State Government of Odisha). Healthcare workers are trained in breast examination, and awareness campaigns have been launched to educate the public about cancer prevention and treatment.

**(b)** The Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) provides 11 vaccines against 12 Vaccine Preventable Diseases. HPV vaccine is not a part of the UIP.

**(c) & (d)** The Central Government implements the Strengthening of Tertiary Cancer Care Centers Facilities Scheme in order to enhance the facilities for cancer care at tertiary level. Under this scheme, 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) which includes Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre, Cuttack and 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centers (TCCCs) have been approved.

Cancer treatment facilities have been approved in all 22 new AIIMS with diagnostic, medical and surgical facilities.
