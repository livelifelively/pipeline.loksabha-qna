## ANSWER

### THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE

### (SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)

**(a) to (d)** Under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, two All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS) have been established, one at Raebareli and the other at Gorakhpur which are functional. Further, under another component of the Scheme upgradation of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College in Meerut has been undertaken on Centre-State cost sharing basis at a cost of Rs. 150 Cr. (Central Share - Rs.120 Crore and State Share - Rs. 30 Crore) by way of construction of 261 bedded Super Speciality Block including 60 ICU beds and 15 dialysis beds having 6 Departments viz Cardiology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Nephrology, Urology, and Burns & Plastic Surgery with 6 Operation Theater (OT). In current phase of PMSSY, there is no proposal for establishment of a new AIIMS in Meerut. “Public Health and Hospitals” is a State subject and the primary responsibility of strengthening the medical infrastructure lies with the respective State Governments.
