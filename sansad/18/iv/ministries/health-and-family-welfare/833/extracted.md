(14555), email, letter to State Health Agencies (SHAs) etc. Based on the nature of grievance,
necessary action including providing of support to the beneficiaries in availing treatment under
the scheme, is taken.

Under AB-PMJAY, claims are settled by respective SHAs. Timely settlement of claims is one of
the key parameters against which the scheme performance is measured. Therefore, the status of
claim settlement under the scheme is constantly monitored to ensure that claims are settled
within defined turnaround time. Necessary action is taken by the National Health Authority
wherever there is a delay in claim payment.

(d): The scheme ensures quality treatment for the beneficiaries. For this, various incentives are
provided to improve the quality of healthcare services. To encourage the participation of public,
private and corporate healthcare providers, empaneled hospitals are additionally incentivized for
accreditation. Incentive of 10% and 15% over and above the package rate is provided to the
hospitals with entry level NABH accreditation and full NABH accreditation, respectively.
Hospitals, which are imparting Post-Graduate education, are also incentivized at the rate of 10%
