## ANSWER

### THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE

### (SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)

**(a) to (d)** The National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) is implemented under the aegis of
the National Health Mission (NHM). Keeping in view costs attached to TB treatment, the
programmatic interventions of NTEP ensure free screening, free diagnostics and free treatment
for all TB patients, at all public health facilities across the country. TB services have been
decentralized to the level of Ayushman Arogya Mandir and free treatment services are availed by
beneficiaries across all public health facilities and identified private health facilities, including
those without health insurance coverage. To further reduce out-of-pocket expenditure and
catastrophic costs, the Government has enhanced benefits under Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY)
from Rs 500 to Rs 1000/month per patient for the duration of treatment. Since April 2018, under
NPY Rs 3,246 Cr has been disbursed to 1.2 Cr beneficiaries. The Ni-kshay Mitra initiative has
been expanded to cover household contacts of TB patients. Since September 2022, 2.55 lakh Ni-
kshay Mitras have been registered and 23.63 lakh food baskets distributed.

The Government has launched a 100 days intensified TB mukt bharat abhiyan on 7th December
2024, in identified 347 priority districts across 33 State/UTs, to accelerate the endeavour to
achieve Sustainable Development Goals related to TB. During 7th December 2024 and 1st
February 2025 under the campaign in 347 districts, 4.94 lakh Ni-kshay shivirs have been held,
5.63 crore vulnerable individuals have been screened and 1.59 lakh new TB patients have been
notified. Further, 86,748 new Ni-kshay Mitras have been registered and 1.12 lakh food baskets
have been disbursed to TB patients and their family members in the campaign districts.

Community involvement through intensive Information, Education & Communication activities
are conducted to ensure solidarity among TB patients and educate the public and raise awareness
about symptoms, prevention and the importance of timely treatment for TB. Jan Bhaghidari
activities are implemented with involvement of Schools, Panchayati Raj Institutions, Self-Help
Groups, Anganwadis, local Non-Government Organisations and Civil Society Organizations.
