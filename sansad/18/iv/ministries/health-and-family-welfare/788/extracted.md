**788. SHRI ANTO ANTONY:**

Will the Minister of HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE be pleased to state:

(a) the steps taken/proposed to be taken by the Government to address the concerns raised about the region-specific naming of fungus as _Trichophyton indotineae_;

(b) whether the Government has engaged with international organizations to review or challenge the naming convention used for the fungus and if so, the details thereof;

(c) the measures are being implemented to combat the spread of _Trichophyton indotineae_ within the country;

(d) whether the Government has data on the prevalence of _Trichophyton indotineae_ infections across different States in the country and if so, the details thereof; and

(e) whether any research initiatives are being funded/proposed to be funded to understand the origin and treatment options for _Trichophyton indotineae_ and if so, the details thereof?

**ANSWER**

**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE**
**(SHRI PRATAPRAO JADHAV)**

**(a) and (b) :** The naming of fungus as _Trichophyton indotineae_ is against World Health Organization (WHO) principles of region-free nomenclature of diseases and disease causing organisms. The Government has accordingly informed WHO.

**(c) :** The Government has undertaken multi-faceted measures to combat the spread of fungus viz., improved mycological diagnosis, awareness about rational use of anti-fungals and corticosteroids, and research into anti-microbials resistance and anti-fungal therapies.

**(d) and (e) :** Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that multiple studies separately done by the dermatologists and mycologists provide information on prevalence from selected populations which are not generalisable across the country as sample size in these studies is very small.

ICMR has undertaken multiple projects to study different issues on this infection including ones to determine the reasons behind the spread of the infection, to understand the prevalence of resistance across the country, to understand the transmission dynamics of this fungus and to evaluate the role of fungal virulence, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of terbinafine in chronic/ recurrent or relapse dermatophytosis.

Also, Department of Science and Technology (DST) has informed that it has supported a research project titled _Genomic insights of azole and terbinafine resistance in clonal Trichophyton mentagrophytes/interdigitalis spp. Complex._
