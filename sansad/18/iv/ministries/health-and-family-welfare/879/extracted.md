sponsored scheme under the National Health Mission. The program is under implementation
across all States and Union Territories for the entire population. The programme covers all
Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) like mental and physical retardation, deaf mutism, cretinism,
still births, abortions etc. with the aim to bring the prevalence of IDD to below 5% in the country
& to ensure 100% consumption of adequately iodated salt (15ppm) at the household level.

To intensify Information, Education & Communication (IEC) activities, a communication
package including Radio/TV spots, video film distribution, development & distribution of
pamphlets to States/UT's and poster depicting various facets of IDD manifestation have been

prepared. Global IDD Prevention Day is observed on 21st October every year. Further, IEC
activities have also been intensified in coordination with the Song & Drama Division,
Directorate of Field Publicity, Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity(DAVP),
Doordarshan & All India Radio (AIR) with a view to promote the consumption of iodised salt
among the masses.

The prevalence of self-reported goitre or thyroid disorder in National Family Health Survey V

The details of State/UT-wise fundsfor Implementation of National Iodine Deficiency Disorders
Control Programme under National Health Mission (NHM) from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25 is
