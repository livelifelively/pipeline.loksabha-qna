**STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA**
**STARRED QUESTION NO. 79 FOR 7<sup>TH</sup> FEBRUARY, 2025**

**(a) to (d)** The Government has launched a 100 days intensified _TB mukt bharat abhiyan_ in identified 347 priority districts across 33 State/UTs, including 8 districts of Himachal Pradesh, to accelerate the endeavour to achieve Sustainable Development Goals related to TB. Out of the total campaign districts, 38 are tribal, 27 are mining and 46 are aspirational districts. The campaign follows a renewed approach to find missing TB cases, reduce TB deaths and prevent new cases. To ensure equitable access, special outreach camps have been organized to screen vulnerable population, offer X-ray and Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) tests, either through mobile medical vans or by mobilizing them to the nearest health facility equipped with X-ray. All services related to TB have been decentralized to the level of Ayushman Arogya Mandir.

Campaign specific Information, Education & Communication (IEC) materials have been developed and disseminated to educate the public and raise awareness about symptoms, prevention and the importance of timely treatment for TB in the campaign States/UTs, including Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. _Jan Bhaghidari_ activities are implemented with involvement of schools, panchayati raj institutions, self help groups, anganwadis, local non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society organizations. 22 line departments have been sensitized to actively support implementation of campaign activities. In addition, the Ministry has sensitized Members of Parliament (MPs), Chief Ministers and State Health Ministers on the campaign.

From the launch of the 100 days intensified TB elimination campaign in 347 districts, 4.94 lakh Ni-kshay shivirs have been held, 5.63 crore vulnerable individuals have been screened and 1.59 lakh new TB patients have been notified. Further, 86,748 new Ni-kshay Mitras have been registered and 1.12 lakh food baskets have been disbursed to TB patients and their family members.

Since the launch of the campaign on 7<sup>th</sup> December, 2024, as per available information, the details of communication activities and efforts made to educate the public, are as under:

- 110 MPs, 426 Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and 27,949 Members of Legislative Councils (MLCs) and elected Panchayati Raj representatives have participated in the campaign.
- 4,173 schools have conducted sensitization sessions with students and teachers.
- 12,402 awareness activities have been conducted with line Ministries and other Government Departments.
- 13,972 activities were held with Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), Trade Associations & Business Associations.
- 1,722 Continued Medical Education (CMEs) sessions were conducted for private health practitioners.
- Screening & testing activities have been conducted in 17,956 congregate settings like prisons, mines, tea gardens, industries, orphanages, old age homes, etc.
- 15,382 awareness activities were held by opinion leaders, community influencers, religious organizations and faith-based organizations

The 100 Days _TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan_ in priority districts, is fully aligned to the long-term TB elimination strategies of prevention, early detection, prompt treatment and reduction of TB related mortality. Mapping of vulnerable population, screening with high sensitive tools like Chest X-ray, upfront NAAT tests for all presumptive TB cases and differentiated TB care for managing high-risk TB cases are all part of the long-term strategies for TB elimination. The campaign strategies are designed to achieve accelerated reduction in TB incidence and mortality and contribute to the long-term national goals for TB elimination.
