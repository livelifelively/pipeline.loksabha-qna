i. Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 provides for data protection and cybersecurity under the IT Act. Section 43A mandates that entities handling sensitive personal data, ensure its protection.

ii. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 provides a framework for the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data

iii. Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 provides for protection of the rights of individuals with mental health conditions and emphasizes consent, autonomy, and non- discrimination

Further, ICMR Guidelines for Biomedical Research (2017) emphasize ethical considerations in medical and scientific research, including neurotechnology. ICMR has also developed Ethical guidelines for application of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Research and Healthcare. Researchers must ensure informed consent and protect participant confidentiality.
