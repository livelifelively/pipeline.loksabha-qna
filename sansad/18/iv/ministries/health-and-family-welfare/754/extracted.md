**ANSWER**

**THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE**

**(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)**

(a) to (d): 'Health' is a State subject. The matters related to regulation and standardization of private healthcare institutions and overcharging by the same are dealt by the concerned States/UTs. Thus, the data in this regard is not maintained centrally.

The Central Government enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 in order to prescribe minimum standards of healthcare facilities and services uniformly in the country. The Act is applicable to all types of clinical establishments in both Government (except owned, controlled and managed by the Armed Forces) and private health facilities. Under the Act, the Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 had been notified which stipulates that all clinical establishments charge the rates for each type of procedures and services within the range of rates determined and issued by the Central Government from time to time in consultation with the State Governments. At present, nineteen States/UTs have adopted the Act and other States/UTs have their own Acts. The responsibility of implementation of the provisions of the Act or the corresponding State Acts, as the case may be, lies with the States/UTs.
